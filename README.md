# Me

Second attempt at a personal website, using [Motif CSS](https://github.com/ktkk/motif-css).
Mainly using this as a place to mess around with web stuff right now.

The Grand Plan is to turn this into a resume/personal website akin to a 90's unix desktop.

For reference, check out the awesome websites featured on [simone.computer](https://simone.computer/#/webdesktops).
